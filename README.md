this bot is built based on a trading strategy that has this steps
1. check if yesterdays candle has shadow in the direction it is moving
2. if it does not have any or it is very smale move to next step
3. check the range of yesterday candle AKA the opening price and the closing prices
4. compaare it with the ATR (avrage true range) of the last 14 days and if it is at list 80% or higher move to the next step
5. if all the condetions are true then there is a high chance that pivot point are going to work as an important prices

the bot basicly does that and i add a function to reset the data base info because it was keep geting removed and the bot woud stop working.
